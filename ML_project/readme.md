During this Project I will use features of discovered and theorized particles from the particle data group (PDG) to predict the rank of aforementioned particles. The Rank quantity is related to how certain the PDG is of the particles existence and experimental evidence and is categorised as such:

Rank - the particle rank as specified by the PDG, i.e., the number of baryon stars: <br>
Possible values are:<br>
4 - Existence is certain, and properties are at least fairly well explored.<br>
3 - Existence ranges from very likely to certain, but further confirmation<br>
is desirable and/or quantum numbers, branching fractions, etc. are not well determined.<br>
2 - Evidence of existence is only fair.<br>
1 - Evidence of existence is poor.<br>
0 - Fundamental Particles - Existence is certain.<br>

The features which will be used to predict this classification label will be: <br>
Mass - The invariant mass of the particle<br>
MassUpper - The upper bound of the mass of the particle<br>
MassLower - The lower bound of the mass of the particle<br>
Width - The decay width of the particle <br>
WidthUpper - The upper bound of the decay width<br>
WidthLower - The lower bound of the decay width<br>
G-parity - multiplicative quantum number that results from the generalization of C-parity to multiplets of particles<br>
Space Parity - Relates to the behaviour of the wavefunction under spatial reflection<br>
Charge Parity - Relates to the behaviour of the wavefunction under charge conjugation<br>
Charge - The charge of the particle measure in (1/3)*(charge of an electron)<br>
Name - Name of the particle<br>
Quarks - If applicable, the quark content of the particle<br> <br>

The aims of this project are to be able to make predictions on the likelihood/discoverability of hypotetical particles using machine learning estimators.
