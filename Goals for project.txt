Goals For Project

Initially would like to obtain football social media data and compare that with the particular teams performance.

Use machine learning pipelines to look for patterns in the data, potentially a classification model which will predict whether a team will go up in their league or down based on social media followers. i.e. if a team is "successful" on social media and gains followers, is this a predictor of club performance.

First tidy up and format the data. Understand it and perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
